o particles with higher DoF (coupled particles)

particle: has location and velocity

unit particle: a particle with a unit mass and globally constant radius

init unit particles: with velocity 1, randomly equaly distributed in all
  directions

wall: a plane, directed (with front), unbounded

unit cube: six planes forming an inward facing (enclosing) cube of size 1

collision time: time when two objects are making surface contact

collision effect: exchange of momentum due to collision, alters the momentum
  of involved objects
